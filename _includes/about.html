            <h1>Hello, I am Brandon. I am the Founder/CEO of <span><b>PerceptionWorks</b></span> and a design mentor at <span><b>ADPList.</b></span></h1>

            <p>
              I developed my entrepreneurial mindset at Ivymount Middle School, then at Kennedy Krieger High School, when I did industry-standard scenarios, had an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and attended a special education school.
              <br>
              <br>
              I learned Adobe programs and learned HTML, CSS and Javascript by creating websites. I am motivated by these experiences to become a part of the technology specialist.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Since I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disability at a young age, I was told that I would need support throughout my life. Previously, Workfocus Development Organization provided me with assistance, but I have never found the type of help I need to pursue a career I truly want.
              <br>
              <br>
              Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disabilities are my superpowers because when combined they make me a powerful entrepreneur.
              <br>
              <br>
              It gives me the ability to be a problem-solver, to have imagination and be more creative, to have a sense of humor and perseverance, as well as a sharp memory and ability to handle multiple tasks.
              <br>
              <br>
              Perception Work is a Digital Design and Technology Company with a wonderful tool help people with disability become more accessible within the digital world that will distribute design and technology to businesses with accessibility challenges.
